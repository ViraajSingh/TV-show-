        <h1>Summary of the Show:</h1>
        <ul>
            <h3>
                <p>
                    The show starts off in the background of <span style=color:red;>Michael Ross</span> and how he is running from the cops becuase of his "bad activities" funny enough he runs into a meeting, in which is one of the best law companies are hosting. He goes there and impressed <span style=color:red;>Harvey Specter</span> who is looking for a second in charge for him. However<span style="color:red;">Mike Ross</span> first tells the truth to <span style="color:red;">Harvey</span> however <span style="color:red;">Harvey</span> is still impressed by <span style="color:red;">Michael Ross</span> and accepts him into the company.
                    In the company <span style="color:red;">Michael Ross</span> does amazing on the cases he is given. However he is a little worried that his secret will come out. In the company he is faced with a problem, he is in the middle of the fight between character <span style="color:red;">Harvey Specter</span> and <span style="color:red;">Louis Litt</span> becuase both lawyers want <span style="color:red;">Michael Ross</span> as their attendents. Both go through many bets and pranks to get <span style="color:red;"> Michael</span> on their side. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    However on the other side of work, there are also romantic tensions that are apparent in the show. The best one in my opinion is between <span style="color:red;">Louis Litt</span> and <span style="color:red;">Donna Paulsen</span>. <span style="color:red;">Louis Litt</span> is in love with <span style="color:red;">Donna Paulsen</span> and it is so obvious, however <span style="color:red;">Donna Paulsen</span> uses this to her advantage and gets what she wants from him. <span style="color:red;">Harvey Specter</span> is like the standard player and never really has a "true love". Another and one of the longest love interest was between <span style="color:red;">Rachel Zane</span> and <span style="color:red;">Michael Ross</span>, in which they both fall in love with each other however <span style="color:red;"> Rachel</span> makes a grave mistake by cheating on <span style="color:red;">Michael</span> causing high tensions between the two.

        <h1>My Opinion</h1>
            <h3>
                <p>For me this is a must watch, it gives such a good background on work in both a serious tone and a funny tone. Talking about tone, the tone switches in the show are amazing and keeps you hooked on to the show. Personally I can see this in the character <span style="color: red;">Harvey</span> the tone that he gives off is so static and that it is also dependent on work and at first it might just be all<span style="color: red;">Harvey</span> is however as the story goes on more it is shown to the viewer, he actually cares for people and mostly<span style="color: red;">Michael.</span>
                   Another reason that it is a must watch is becuase it offers a persepctive on how peopel are willing to use others for thei rown success and how toxic intense work situations are such as being a lawyer, and could be really intreasting to someone who wants to major in law.
